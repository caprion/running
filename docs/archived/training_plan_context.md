## Key Insight from Chennai Race

The Dec 7 training run showed 5:33/km flat-equivalent capability over 21km, implying ~1:56-1:57 HM potential. Chennai result of 2:08:26 was executed conservatively due to:
- Heat/humidity (~28-30°C)
- Deliberate 6:40/km start (overcautious by ~15s/km)
- First serious HM at this fitness level

**Primary limiter identified:** Race execution confidence, not fitness.

## Goal Structure

### 10K Race (Week 14 - Mid April 2026)
- **A-Goal:** 52:00 (5:12/km) — validates sub-2:00 HM fitness
- **B-Goal:** 54:00 (5:24/km) — confirms 2:00-2:03 HM capability
- **C-Goal:** 56:00 (5:36/km) — indicates 2:05-2:08 HM range

### Half Marathon (Week 20 - Late May 2026)
- **A-Goal:** 2:00 (5:41/km)
- **B-Goal:** 2:03 (5:50/km)
- **C-Goal:** 2:06 (5:58/km)

### Season Progression Target
- 2-3 min improvement per season while at 6:00/km pace range
- Degradation point: Below 5:40/km (~1:59 HM), improvement rate slows to 1-2 min/season

## Race Execution Plans

### 10K Race Strategy

| Segment | Target Pace | Effort | Strategy |
|---------|-------------|--------|----------|
| km 1-2 | 5:20-5:25 | 80% | Settle, don't chase adrenaline |
| km 3-6 | 5:15-5:20 | 85% | Find rhythm, stay relaxed |
| km 7-8 | 5:10-5:20 | 90% | Assess what's left |
| km 9-10 | Max sustainable | 95%+ | Empty the tank |

### Half Marathon Strategy

| Segment | Target Pace | Effort | Strategy |
|---------|-------------|--------|----------|
| km 1-3 | 5:45-5:50 | 75% | Controlled, don't chase |
| km 4-10 | 5:40-5:45 | 85% | Find groove, stay relaxed |
| km 11-16 | 5:38-5:42 | 88% | Push rhythm slightly |
| km 17-21 | 5:35-5:40 or max | 92-95% | Finish strong |

### HM Goal Calibration by 10K Result

| 10K Result | Predicted HM | Start Pace | Strategy |
|------------|--------------|------------|----------|
| 52:00 | 1:56-1:58 | 5:35/km | Aggressive, negative split |
| 54:00 | 2:00-2:02 | 5:42/km | Standard, slight negative |
| 56:00 | 2:05-2:07 | 5:50/km | Conservative execution |

## Contingency Rules

### Adjustment Protocols

| Scenario | Running Response | Strength Response |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Miss 1 run in week | Continue plan, don't double up | Keep strength |
| Miss 2+ runs | Repeat week or reduce 20% | Keep strength |
| Travel week (can run) | 3×5km easy minimum | 1 bodyweight session |
| Travel week (cannot run) | 0km acceptable | 2 bodyweight sessions |
| Illness <3 days | Resume cautiously at 50% | Resume at 50% |
| Illness >5 days | Reset to previous phase 1 week | Reset to Wk 3 loads |
| Minor pain (<3/10) | Skip intervals, keep easy | Modify around pain |
| Pain >3 days or >5/10 | Stop running, medical eval | Upper body only |

### Minimum Viable Week (Floor)

| Condition | Running Minimum | Strength Minimum |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Normal week | 35-45 km (4-5 runs) | 2 full + 2 activation |
| Busy/travel week | 15-20 km (3×5-7km easy) | 1 bodyweight session |
| Sick/injured | 0-10 km | Upper body if able |

### Key Decision Rules

- If in doubt, run easy instead of hard
- Never add volume/intensity to "make up" missed days
- 3 consecutive bad workouts = take 3 extra easy days
- Resting HR elevated >5 bpm for 3 days = reduce load 30%
- Any sharp pain = stop immediately
- Sleep <6 hours = convert next quality session to easy
- Race week: if anything feels off, default to conservative pacing

---

## Historical Context

### Volume Pattern Issue (2025)
- Jan-Mar: 30-45 km/week (motivated, building)
- Apr-Jul: 5-20 km/week (travel, family events — volume collapse)
- Aug-Dec: 25-45 km/week (race-focused rebuild)

**Root cause:** No minimum viable volume floor during disruption periods.

**Solution:** 15-20 km/week floor during travel/busy weeks (3×5-7km easy). Never drop below this unless injured.

### Chennai Race Analysis (Jan 4, 2026)

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Official time | 2:08:26 | Beat 2:10 goal by 94s |
| Start pace | 6:40/km | Overcautious by ~15s/km |
| Middle pace (km 6-16) | 6:01-6:11 | Remarkably consistent |
| Finish pace (km 17-20) | 5:57-6:07 | Strong, no fade |
| Conditions | ~28-30°C, high humidity | 3-5 min penalty vs cool weather |
| Dec 27 run (8 days out) | 13.27km @ 6:25 | Slightly aggressive for taper |

**Key learning:** Fitness was undertapped. Race execution confidence is the primary limiter, not aerobic capacity.

| Mar 6 | Intervals 6×1km@5:35 | Speed development | Faster than Feb with similar effort |
| Mar 22 | Long run with 10K pace finish | Race-specific | Last 3km@5:50 feeling controlled |
| Apr 3 | Sharpener 4×600m@5:15 | Pre-10K neuromuscular | Snappy, not tired |
| **Apr 12** | **10K Race** | Execution practice | 52:00-54:00 |
| May 3 | Long run 10km@5:45-5:50 | Key HM-specific | Sustain HM pace for 10km |
| **May 24** | **Half Marathon** | Goal race | 2:00-2:03 |

## Summary

This is a 20-week campaign to take a 2:08 HM runner with demonstrated 5:33/km training capability to a sub-2:03 (ideally sub-2:00) HM through:

1. **Consistent volume** (35-50 km/week with minimum floor)
2. **Integrated strength** (2×/week, periodized with running phases)
3. **Progressive intensity** (tempo → intervals → race-specific long runs)
4. **10K tune-up race** for execution practice and goal calibration
5. **Conservative taper** with explicit deload weeks built in

The constraint is not fitness — it's accessing fitness through confident race execution.
