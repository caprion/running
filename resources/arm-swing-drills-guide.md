# Arm Swing Drills & Form Guide

**Purpose:** Fix static 90° arm hold → Dynamic "drumming" arm swing
**Timeline:** Weeks 1-12 (ingrain new pattern), then maintenance
**Gait Analysis:** Every 4 weeks (Weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17)

## The Problem Identified

**Current Pattern:**
- Arms held rigid at 90° angle
- Limited anterior-posterior (forward-back) swing
- Static position rather than dynamic drumming motion
- Energy waste from tension, especially in shoulders

**Target Pattern:**
- Relaxed shoulders (dropped, not hunched)
- Elbows ~90° BUT with movement (not locked)
- Hands swing from hip pocket (back) to chest/nipple line (front)
- Minimal crossover (hands stay in their lane)
- Rhythmic "drumming" motion drives from shoulder
- Linked to leg cadence (faster arms = faster legs)

## Daily Pre-Run Drill (EVERY RUN - 2 minutes)

**Standing Arm Swing Drill**

Do this before EVERY run for at least 8-12 weeks:

1. **Stand relaxed**, feet hip-width apart
2. **Shake out arms** - let them hang loose
3. **"Chicken wings"** - flap arms to loosen shoulders (5-10 seconds)
4. **Start slow arm swing:**
   - Hip pocket → chest height
   - Opposite arms (right arm forward when left leg forward)
   - Focus: Shoulders DOWN, hands relaxed (holding potato chips - don't crush)
5. **Gradually speed up** while staying relaxed:
   - 30 seconds slow
   - 30 seconds race pace rhythm
   - 30 seconds sprint pace rhythm
6. **Key cue:** "Drive elbows BACK" (not forward)

**Total time:** 2 minutes
**When:** Immediately before every run (part of warm-up ritual)

## During-Run Drills

### Drill 1: Exaggerated Arm Swing (Easy Runs - Tue/Sun)

**When:** During easy runs, 3-4 times per run
**Duration:** 30-60 seconds per burst

**How:**
1. For 30-60 seconds, OVER-EXAGGERATE the arm swing
2. Swing hands from hip pocket all the way to chest height
3. Feel silly? Good - you're doing it right
4. Notice legs automatically speed up
5. Relax back to normal (but keep some of that range)

**Timing:** Every 5-10 minutes during the run (km 2, 3, 4, 5)

**Cue:** "Hip to chest, hip to chest"

---

### Drill 2: "Cheek to Cheek" (Quality Runs - Thursday)

**When:** During warm-up or easy portions
**Duration:** 2 x 30 seconds

**How:**
1. **First 30s:** Exaggerated backswing - "elbow to the person behind you"
   - Feel shoulder blades squeeze together
   - Focus on the BACK part of swing
2. **Relax 1 minute**
3. **Second 30s:** Repeat with relaxed rhythm

**Cue:** "Punch backward, not forward"

---

### Drill 3: Exaggerated Swings on Long Run (Saturday)

**When:** Every 5 minutes during long run
**Duration:** 20-30 second bursts

**How:**
1. Check in with shoulders - are they creeping up?
2. Shake them out briefly
3. 20-30 seconds of exaggerated full range arm swing
4. Return to relaxed natural swing
5. Repeat every 5 minutes

**Cue:** "Relaxed rhythm, full range"

---

### Drill 4: Strides with Arm Focus (Week 3+ Thursday)

**When:** After easy warm-up, before quality workout
**Duration:** 4-6 x 20 seconds

**How:**
1. 20 seconds at 5K race effort (~5:30-5:40/km for you)
2. **Focus:** Quick, light arm swing (180+ cadence)
3. Walk back for full recovery
4. Think: "Quick arms, light feet"

**Purpose:**
- Train arm-leg coordination
- Increase natural cadence
- Build neuromuscular pattern of relaxed speed

---

### Drill 5: Downhill Relaxed Sprints (Week 3+ Saturday - Optional)

**When:** During Saturday long run if gentle downhill available
**Duration:** 1-2 x 50-100m

**How:**
1. Find gentle downhill (not steep)
2. **Let gravity pull you** into faster pace
3. **Focus:** Keep arms relaxed, shoulders dropped, full swing
4. Don't force speed - let it happen from relaxed form
5. Walk back up for recovery

**Cue:** "Let gravity do the work, arms stay loose"

---

## Post-Run Shoulder Exercises (Tue/Sun - 5 minutes)

Add to existing post-run activation:

### 1. Shoulder Blade Squeezes (2 x 15)
- Standing, arms at 90°
- Squeeze shoulder blades together (retract)
- Hold 2 seconds, release
- **Teaches:** Proper backswing movement pattern

### 2. Band Pull-Aparts (2 x 15)
- Light resistance band
- Arms extended forward, chest height
- Pull band apart (hands to sides)
- **Strengthens:** Rear delts, counteracts forward shoulder roll

---

## Strength Session Additions (Session B - Wednesday)

Add to existing Session B:

### Scapular Push-Ups (2 x 10)
- Standard push-up position
- Keep arms straight
- Pinch shoulder blades together, then push them apart
- **Strengthens:** Serratus anterior for shoulder stability

**Note:** YTWL Raises and Face Pulls (already in plan) also help arm swing - keep these!

---

## Key Cues During Runs

Use these mental reminders:

1. **"Shoulders down and back"** (not hunched forward)
2. **"Drive elbows back"** (backswing is key)
3. **"Loose hands, tight core"** (don't clench fists)
4. **"Hip to chest"** (range of motion)
5. **"Quick arms, light feet"** (for cadence work)
6. **"Drummer, not robot"** (relaxed rhythm, not rigid)

| 17 | May 2 | Pre-HM specific | `2026-05-02-week17-[side/rear].mp4` |

### Video Recording Setup

**Camera angles needed:**

1. **Side view (most important)**
   - Position: 10-15m perpendicular to running path
   - Height: Hip level
   - Capture: Full body in frame
   - Duration: 10-15 seconds

2. **Rear view**
   - Position: Directly behind, 10-15m away
   - Height: Hip level
   - Capture: Full body
   - Duration: 10-15 seconds

**Recording tips:**
- Wear fitted shorts/tights (see leg movement)
- Run at easy pace (6:30-7:00/km - your natural gait)
- Don't try to "fix" anything - run naturally
- Treadmill or outdoor straight path works
- 10-15 seconds is enough

## What to Expect (Timeline)

| Week | Expected Progress |
|------|-------------------|
| 1-2 | Feels weird/exaggerated; requires conscious focus every run |
| 3-4 | Starts to feel more natural during easy runs; still awkward during quality |
| 5-6 | Noticeable improvement in gait video; less shoulder fatigue |
| 7-8 | Can maintain relaxed arms during tempo runs (not just easy) |
| 9-12 | Becoming automatic; only occasional conscious check-ins needed |
| 13+ | New pattern mostly ingrained; shows up naturally in races |

## Troubleshooting

### "My shoulders get tired from the drills"
- **Normal!** Means you're using muscles that were dormant
- Back off intensity slightly (shorter bursts)
- Keep doing post-run shoulder exercises
- Soreness should decrease within 2-3 weeks

### "I can't maintain it during hard workouts"
- **Expected!** Hard efforts = revert to old patterns
- Focus on maintaining during warm-up and cool-down
- Quality workouts: check form in first/last km only
- By Week 7-8, you'll maintain it during tempos

### "I forget to do the pre-run drill"
- **Set phone reminder** for workout time
- Make it part of dynamic warm-up (tie shoelaces → arm drill → start watch)
- Put a note on your watch or phone lock screen
- Miss it once? Do it mid-run for 30 seconds

### "It feels unnatural/silly"
- **Good!** Means you're changing the pattern
- Exaggeration is temporary (weeks 1-6)
- Natural swing will settle in between old pattern and exaggeration
- By Week 8, it won't feel silly anymore

---

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

- ✅ Shoulders feel less fatigued after long runs
- ✅ Can run faster with same effort (better efficiency)
- ✅ Notice increased cadence without trying
- ✅ Friends/training partners comment on improved form
- ✅ Gait videos show visible anterior-posterior arm swing
- ✅ Racing feels more fluid in final kilometers
- ✅ No longer thinking about arms - happens automatically
